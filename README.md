# Overview
IoTeX Reactor is a major component of the IoTeX Platform that equips "Powered by IoTeX" devices with foundational capabilities for new levels of security, privacy, and trust. Reactor consists of several IoT-oriented libraries/tools that enable powerful capabilities for embedded devices, including decentralized identity (DID), end-to-end encryption, device authentication, over-the-air (OTA) updates, and more.

* Decentralized Identity (DID): cryptographically verifiable, universally resolvable, and IoTeX-powered identity framework for people, devices, and businesses
* End-to-End Encryption: secure communication that prevents unwarranted access to data while it's transferred from one system/device to another
* Device Authentication: framework to for secure boot, session establishment, and identity authorization to activate "Powered by IoTeX" devices
* OTA Updates: distribution of new software, firmware, settings, and more to "Powered by IoTeX" devices in a decentralized and remote fashion
